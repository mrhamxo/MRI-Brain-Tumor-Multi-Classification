# MRI-Brain-Tumor-Multi-detection-system

This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to detect the presence and type of brain tumors from MRI images using a pre-trained deep learning model. The application supports grayscale MRI images, normalizes and preprocesses them, and displays the detection results along with confidence scores.

## Features
- **Interactive Interface**: Upload MRI images directly via the Streamlit app.
- **Tumor Detection**: Classifies MRI scans into one of the following categories:
  - `Pituitary`
  - `Glioma`
  - `No Tumor`
  - `Meningioma`
- **Confidence Score**: Displays the confidence percentage of the prediction.
- **Image Compatibility**: Handles both grayscale and color images, converting them as needed.

## How to Use
1. Launch the app using Streamlit.
2. Upload an MRI image in `jpg`, `jpeg`, or `png` format.
3. View the prediction results and confidence score.
4. The uploaded image and results will be displayed in the interface.

## Example

**Sample Output:**
- Uploaded MRI image.
- Predicted result: `Tumor: Glioma`
- Confidence: `93.45%`

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For the deep learning model.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pillow**: For image preprocessing.
